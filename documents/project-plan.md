## Abstract

The problem of attributing a piece of code, particularly a binary file, to a known author using machine learning is complex and must be decomposed into several logical steps. The problem will be tackled by predicting authorship by extracting and analysing the features of the binary code provided. The objectives include: reviewing existing techniques for binary feature extraction, building a dataset of binaries from multiple authors, implementing and testing preliminary machine learning classifiers on extracted features, and evaluating early test results and refining the approach accordingly.
