## Author Attribution of Binaries with Machine Learning
### Aims

Exploring the attribution of a piece of code to a known author using machine learning techniques

### Background

Attributing binaries, whether malicious or benign, is a difficult and time consuming task however, there is an increase demand for this either for attributing cyber attacks or preventing plagiarism. The goal of this project is to explore the use of machine learning to predict authorship of binaries. You will use a corpus of open source software either for static or dynamic analysis of binaries to classify or cluster the binaries into authors. The project has several technical parts and you will be encouraged to logically build up your technical capabilities.

### Prerequisites

- Basics of binary analysis, some knowledge of Python/C, some basic notions of machine learning.
- Being able to autonomously download/compile/install tools from various repositories (e.g., GitHub).

### Early Deliverables

- A report describing techniques/methods to extract features from binaries
- A preliminary tool to extract features from binaries (e.g., control-flow graphs)
- Creation of a reasonably large dataset composed of malware binaries coming from different authors or groups (e.g., APTs)
- A preliminary set of tests with machine learning classifiers (e.g. using scikit-learn) to classify a subset of the dataset based on the extracted features

### Final Deliverables

- An analysis of techniques and methods to extract features from binaries
- Describe and analyse the techniques and features that have been used during the project to extract and attribute binaries
- Describe in detail the design of the attribution system
- Test the system on the entire dataset and discuss the results
- A report on suggestions for improving the proposed tool
